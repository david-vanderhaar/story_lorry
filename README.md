## A Short Story Collection Scraper Maker

This tool allows a user to select a website, blog, etc. and scrape a collection of texts which can then be compiled into a pdf (or some other format) and sent to one's kindle for easy reading.

User can select:
url entry point,
DOM element and/or link format to target,
cover image for the collection (or auto-generated using Soul Tarot?)
title of collection
file name
file type (pdf to start)

I created this as a way to read some of my favorite blogs and freely availble short stories on my Kindle Paperwhite.
